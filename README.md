## Our approach

### Mission

Our mission is to Enable humanity to continue to grow by catching its attention. How? 

We decided to encourage and provide exposure to organizations that promote and create environment-friendly products in order to reduce waste and pollution. The core of the app is based on a simple mechanism: the organization provides a discount code, afterwards an offer is added to a queue. Each week, an offer is activated. The Offer enables users to redeem the code, use it and complete the survey regarding the product. 

### Gamification 

Based on the number of surveys the users complete, a Leaderboard will be created. Monthly, the top 10 users would be awarded different prizes from our partners that had active offers during the month. 

Moreover, a user will be able to maintain a Streak of completed surveys. Based on the Streak, he will be awarded different Badges and he will be able to unlock offers earlier.

Aside from the surveys created by our partners, we will offer a series of Quizzez regarding Environment-friendly topics. After completing each quiz, based on the score obtained, the user's overall points linked to the profile will increase, therefore closer to obtaining a Leaderboard monthly prize!

### Technologies

In order to focus high-availability, we opted for a web application implemented with .NET and React.
